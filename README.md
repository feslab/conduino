The package contains the following files:

- Bill of materials, in XLSX format, with Mouser codes;
- Wiring schematics, in PDF;
- Assembly view, in PDF;
- Manufacturing drawings of the printed circuit board, in PDF (labeled “TOP” and “BOT”);
- JPG pictures of the top and bottom of the assembled board. Note the large capacitor on the top is optional.
- Arduino firmware, to be loaded once on the Arduino UNO that will be used;
- A Matlab script for running multichannel acquisition;
- A copy of the paper describing the Conduino, which also illustrates possible electrodes.
